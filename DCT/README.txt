I have taken the input from .xlsx file for which I had to read the input file ,I used the library apache 

poi for that.

There are some jar files which I used to read the .xlsx file.
-> I used PCA transform as my cutoff function and made it read 3 sheets of .xslx file
which reduces the dimension to a much greater extent.

-> I ran my code on eclipse and important point is I was using a string fname to give the patha of .xslx file.
So please change the path of the .xlsx file before running the program.
